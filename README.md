Secret Family Recipes Cookbook
PROJECT NAME
Secret Family Recipes Cookbook

DESCRIPTION
Pitch: Anyone can go out and buy a cookbook these days, but I want a place to store all my secret family recipes, handed down from generation to generation. The little cards my grandma wrote the recipes on in her beautiful cursive are getting lost or are hard to read. I need somewhere secure to keep my recipes with me at all times!

MVP (UI):
- You will build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by your group and provides the user with details about the product your team has selected to build.

Webpage built, Main marketing and About Us team page.

- Your marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths. Please see the "Responsiveness" portion of your rubric for more information on this.

Breakpoints at 1000px and 500px  as requested.

- The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that your Front End Architect is building.

Our design called for a "Join" button. There is one at the top and one at the bottom that link to the App.

- Your marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like "Netlify" or "Github Pages".

Hosted on Netlify at https://family-recipe-cookbook.netlify.com/index.html

- For this Marketing site's home page you need to have content and copy that relates to the product that your team is workinfg on.
- Descriptions about the product and about the features it provides would be key.

Copy and related pictures created.

- For a second page, you could do an about us section that includes images of the members of your team, and links to one another's socials/Github.

All team members included.

Stretch (UI):

-Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built and the student went above and beyond the project.

Added many items outside Lambda core curriculum (see below).

-Pair programmed with the Front End Architect

Joined the Live Share with the FEs and watched them build and troubleshoot our app to get an idea of what React was all about. Have also compared code with the other UI dev to help UX designer meet her goals.

-Student's code is clean and organized, proper indentation is apparent, a library or framework was researched and used.

Used Prettier and Less to keep code clean and organized. Used an animation library to animate buttons. Leveraged Bootstrap to create a carousel for the About Us.

-Tablet views look professional at 800px and above. Responsive units are used for font-sizing.

Tablet breakpoint added. All major layout structures are percentages. All font sizes are REM.
