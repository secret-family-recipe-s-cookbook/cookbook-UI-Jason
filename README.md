# Welcome to Secret Family Recipes Cookbook where you can save and share your family's culinary heritage.

### Anyone can go out and buy a cookbook these days, but I want a place to store all my secret family recipes, handed down from generation to generation. The little cards my grandma wrote the recipes on in her beautiful cursive are getting lost or are hard to read. I need somewhere secure to keep my recipes with me at all times!.

## Current Features:

PROJECT NAME
Secret Family Recipes Cookbook

# MVP (UI):
- You will build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by your group and provides the user with details about the product your team has selected to build.

### Webpage built, Main marketing and About Us team page.

- Your marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths. Please see the "Responsiveness" portion of your rubric for more information on this.

### Breakpoints at 1000px and 500px  as requested.

- The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that your Front End Architect is building.

### Our design called for a "Join" button. There is one at the top and one at the bottom that link to the App.

- Your marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like "Netlify" or "Github Pages".

### Hosted on Netlify at https://family-recipe-cookbook.netlify.com/index.html. Linked to Git repo to auto-update.

- For this Marketing site's home page you need to have content and copy that relates to the product that your team is working on.
- Descriptions about the product and about the features it provides would be key.

### Marketing copy and related pictures added using unsplash and pexels.

- For a second page, you could do an about us section that includes images of the members of your team, and links to one another's socials/Github.

### All team members included.

# Stretch (UI):

-Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built and the student went above and beyond the project.

### Added items outside Lambda core curriculum. Used text shadow around H1 text on homepage to pop it off the hero image. Further used opacity, and radius to make a background further improving readability. Navigation links grow in size on hover to show that they are clickable. Used box shadows to draw the eye to selling points. Marketing titles are also shadowed to make them pop. (also see below).

-Pair programmed with the Front End Architect

### Joined the Live Share with the FEs and watched them build and troubleshoot our app to get an idea of what React was all about. Have also compared code with the other UI dev to help UX designer meet her goals. All three of us were in close contact throughout the project through zoom and slack.

-Student's code is clean and organized, proper indentation is apparent, a library or framework was researched and used.

### Used Prettier and Less to keep code clean organized and DRY. Used an animation library to animate navigation buttons. Leveraged Bootstrap to create a carousel for the About Us.

-Tablet views look professional at 800px and above. Responsive units are used for font-sizing.

### Tablet breakpoint added at 800px. All major layout structures are percentages. All font sizes are REM.
